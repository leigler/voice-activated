# Week One Readings

- [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) by Jakob Nielson
- [Design guidelines for voice user interfaces](https://uxdesign.cc/design-guidelines-for-voice-user-interfaces-3c3b73982f4c) by Marc Ericson Santons, PhD

## Exercise
To discuss our readings for this week, lets get into groups of 3-4.

For each reading, answer each of the following questions together:

- which is the most important point?
- what is a point you would remove? and why?
- what is a point you would add or think is missing?

Collect your answers in a google doc and be prepared to share them with the class (and give us viewing access (eigll343@newschool.edu + shinr377@newschool.edu)).

If you have any additional questions or comments regarding the readings, bring them up in your presentation!
