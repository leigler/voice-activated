# Input/Out Critique Format
## March 6

### Round Robin
For this week, we will use a *round robin* format: each group will meet with three other groups to gather feedback. 

In giving your feedback, try addressing the following questions:  
- How is the interaction explained to you? 
- What is interesting about the interaction? is there anything new? what does it remind you of? 
- How would you introduce each of the 5 stages of interaction?

In recieving feedback, try to take notes separately from your group partner. This will allow you to get an additional perspective on each piece of feedback.


### Classwide
Once everyone has gotten feedback, let&rsquo;s quickly go around the room and answer this question:
- Which interaction was the most popular? why do you think that is?
